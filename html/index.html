    <m1 class="Maintext" >This project was made to investigate the differences between triple-junction amorphous and poly-crystalline
        solar panels, and to inform people about the potential benefits of switching to solar energy. The links above provide a
        calculator that estimates the potential profit of switching to solar, a comparison between the 2 types of solar panels, and a
        compilation of the last 10 years of data collected by existing solar panels in the University of Iowa's Electric Vehicle Charging
        Array.
